# Forbes-project

There are 2212 people from 71 countries collectively worth $9.1 trillion. The majority of the billionaires in the world are self-made self-starters who built business empires in tech, finance, fashion, and sports. There are some who got a head start with inherited stakes in their family's companies. This project is all about analysis on all the billionaires around the world.
